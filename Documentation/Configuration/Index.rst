=============
Configuration
=============

Configuring content elements can be done for the frontend and the backend.

The appearance of the content elements can be changed by overriding the
:ref:`default settings <site-set-fluid-styled-content-settings>` provided
by the site set :ref:`"Fluid Styled Content" <site-set-fluid-styled-content>`.

You can also :ref:`override the Fluid
templates <overriding-fluid-templates>` provided by this extension.

For the backend, fields can be shown or hidden, depending on the fields you are using or
the fields an editor is allowed to use. Configuration like this is done using
*Page TSconfig* or *User TSconfig*.
