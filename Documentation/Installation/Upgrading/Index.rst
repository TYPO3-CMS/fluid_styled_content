Upgrading
=========

If you upgrade your TYPO3 CMS installation from one major version to another (for example
6.2 to 7.6), it is advised to run the Upgrade Wizards. They guide you through the
necessary steps to upgrade your database records or explicitly install extensions that
ship with the latest TYPO3 CMS version.

Coming from an older version it might be that the basic content elements, provided by
the core of TYPO3 CMS were rendered by the extension "CSS Styled Content
(css_styled_content)". Some changes have been made since moving the rendering to the
extension "fluid_styled_content". Some database fields of the table tt_content are no longer
used, the fields of FlexForms have been moved to proper database fields and the content
elements "Text" and "Text & Images" have been merged into a new content element "textmedia".
To make sure you do not lose any information or the content elements look differently on
your upgraded website run these Upgrade Wizards.

The upgrade wizards can be found in the Install tool.

.. attention::

   The predefined CONTENT objects :ts:`styles.content.getLeft`,
   :ts:`styles.content.getRight` and :ts:`styles.content.getBorder` are not
   provided anymore. :ts:`styles.content.get` still exists for your convenience. Most of
   the current websites are using "backend layouts", where the predefined numbering of the
   columns does not make sense.


.. tip::

   If you are still using the predefined CONTENT objects, you can use the following
   TypoScript:

   .. code-block:: typoscript

      styles.content {

         # get content, left
         getLeft < styles.content.get
         getLeft.select.where = colPos=1

         # get content, right
         getRight < styles.content.get
         getRight.select.where = colPos=2

         # get content, border
         getBorder < styles.content.get
         getBorder.select.where = colPos=3

         # get news
         getNews < styles.content.get
         getNews.select.pidInList = {$styles.content.getNews.newsPid}
      }
